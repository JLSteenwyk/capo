# Validation record

September 12, 2026, macOS, Python 3.14.5.

## Automated checks

`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -q` passes 22 tests. Coverage includes the full objective loop with fake providers, replayable Git patches, review-driven revision, verification/acceptance gates, bounded model calls, interrupted-run recovery, exclusive supervisor ownership, path protections, provider errors, subprocess termination, log-size limits, and explicit team selection.

`git diff --check` passes. The CLI help and executable doctor run successfully.

## Live provider probes

| Provider | Version | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | 2.1.263 | Structured JSON response validated |
| Codex | 0.154.0 | Structured JSON response validated |
| Grok Build | 1.0.13 | Sandbox initialization failed before a model response |
| Grok Build, isolated downloaded copy | 1.0.30 | Same sandbox initialization failure |

Grok reported that the runtime-socket deny path `/var/run/docker.sock` is a symlink and refused to start without its requested read-only protections. The original installation and sandbox settings were preserved. A live Grok response contract remains unverified on this host.

## Live development objective

A temporary Git repository contained a faulty `add(a, b)` function that subtracted its arguments. Capo ran with explicit `--workers codex --reviewer claude` configuration:

1. Claude produced a plan.
2. Codex proposed the corrected file.
3. The runtime applied it in a separate clone.
4. A Python verification command passed positive, mixed-sign, and zero cases.
5. A separate Claude review approved the change.
6. Claude accepted the objective against the recorded evidence.

The objective completed in four model calls and one round. The original checkout remained unchanged. The runtime retained the staged fix, patch, attempt artifacts, verification output, and delivery report.

This verifies the small local workflow. It does not establish general coding quality, hostile-code isolation, unattended reliability, remaining subscription capacity, Grok interoperability, or future computer-use capabilities.
